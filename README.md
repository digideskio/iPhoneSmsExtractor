#iPhone SMS Extractor

The idea is to grab an iPhone backup and pull all SMS and iMessage records out of it into an easily readable format.

Right now it just kinda dumps messages into ugly, unstyled HTML.

Console app, .NET 4.0, 64-bit OS, Windows Vista or 7 only.

**Disclaimer: I make no promises that downloading and running this will not make your computer explode or your phone backups disappear. I gave basically zero thought to error handling and recovery at this point.**
